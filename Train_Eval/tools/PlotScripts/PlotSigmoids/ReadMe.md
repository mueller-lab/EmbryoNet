This directory contains scripts to plot "Sigmoids". By "Sigmoid" we here denote distribution of embyo phenotypes over time during single experiment or a series of experiments with the same number of frames. 
They usually look similar to sigmoid function graph.

* `plot_session_from_excel.py`

Plots Sigmoid for a given excel file generated by `tools/datasets/collect_datasets_description.py`.

`python plot_sessions_from_excel -x "path_to_generated_.xlsx"`

* `plot_session_graph.py`

Plots session "Sigmoids" for a given path to session with experiments. 
Plots the same plots as `plot_session_from_excel.py` for a single session and without splitting into train/test/no_train_no_test.

`python plot_session_graph.py -p path_to_session`

Folder structure is important. 
Each phenotype has several experiment sessions inside.
Each experiment session has several wells inside.
Each well has at least one labeler. 
Number of json files in each well belonging to one experiment should be the same:
script will not work if you have experiment well_n with "n" json files and another well_m with "m" j_json files where m != n.
